# ICOS Agent

{{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

{{ template "chart.description" . }}


The ICOS Agent is responsible for managing the continuum (keeping track of the topology and availability of the current system) and the run-time (launching and monitoring the execution of services on-demand). Each ICOS Controller manages a set of Agents based on a proximity criteria; hence, ICOS Controllers are deployed on resource-rich computing facilities along the continuum to cover the whole geographical area.

This repository contains all the necessary information to install and deploy the ICOS Agent in a Kubernetes cluster.
